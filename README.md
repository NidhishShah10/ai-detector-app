# ai-detector-app
This is a web app that brings together AI detection and natural language processing to detect AI-written essays and rephrase them to be more human-like. With the growing use of AI essay-writing tools such as ChatGPT in academic and professional environments, it has become imperative to be able to detect and interpret AI-written content. The web app takes in any essay or piece of text and then  intelligently rephrases the detected AI-written content while maintaining the original meaning but in a more natural and human-like writing style.
